    <p>Many years after defeating the Olympian gods, Kratos now lives with <br />his son Atreus in the realm of Midgard.
      After
      cremating the body of his<br /> second wife, Faye, Kratos is confronted by a stranger with godly powers<br /> and
      strength.
      The two
      battle and Kratos seemingly kills the stranger,<br /> after which Kratos and Atreus begin their journey to honor
      Faye's
      last<br />
      wish: to scatter her ashes at the highest peak in the nine realms. Along <br />the way, they encounter the kindly
      Witch
      of the
      Woods, who recognises<br /> Kratos as a god.

      chaos
      with<br /> his
      brother Tommy and daughter Sarah. As they flee, Sarah is shot by a<br /> soldier and dies

    <p>Aloy is cast out from the Nora tribe at birth and raised by a fellow outcast<br /> named Rost. As a
      child, Aloy obtains a Focus, an augmented reality device<br /> that gives her special perceptive abilities. Aloy
      becomes curious about her<br /> origins and is told by Rost that if she wins the Proving, a competition to
      earn<br />
      the
      right to
      become a member of the Nora, the tribe's Matriarchs might concede<br /> this information. Aloy spends some years
      training in
      combat and survival<br /> under Rost's instruction.
