    <img src="https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/manga/2/168695.jpg" alt="poster of 20th Century Boys" width="300" />
    <p>As the 20th century approaches its end, people all over the world are anxious<br /> that the world is changing.
      And
      probably
      not for the better.

      Kenji Endo is<br /> a normal convenience store manager who's just trying to get by. But when he<br /> learns that
      one of
      his
      old
      friends going by the name "Donkey" has suddenly<br /> committed suicide, and that a new cult led by a figure
      known as
      "Friend"
      is<br /> becoming more notorious, Kenji starts to feel that something isn't right. With<br /> a few key clues left
      behind by
      his
      deceased friend, Kenji realizes that this cult<br /> is much more than he ever thought it would be—not only is
      this
      mysterious
      <br />organization directly targeting him and his childhood friends, but the whole<br /> world also faces a grave
      danger
      that
      only
      the friends have the key to stop.
