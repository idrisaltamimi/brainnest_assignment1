    <p>Hunters devote themselves to accomplishing hazardous tasks, <br />
      all from traversing the world's uncharted territories to locating <br />
      rare items and monsters. Before becoming a Hunter, one must<br />
      pass the Hunter Examinationâ€”a high-risk selection process in<br />
      which most applicants end up handicapped or worse, deceased.

    <p>J-pop idol group CHAM! has spent the last two years entertaining <br />

      her acting career. While Mima's choice is met with a mixed response,<br />
      she hopes her fans will continue to support her.
